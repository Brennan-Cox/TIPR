## Name
Transform Invariant Pattern Recognition

## Description
Program takes a set of images, applies a random affine transformation to the image, then uses a combination of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and optimal transport (OT) to find the minimum cost OT transport plan while exploring dimensions of transformation through PSO ability to search a mulitdimenstional space

## Installation

Download and Install
- [ ] Install Fonts at: https://github.com/davidstutz/disentangling-robustness-generalization (FONTS dataset)
- [ ] Visual Studio C++, and python dev extensions
- [ ] Visual Studio Code (Needed to visualize with jupyter)
- [ ] vscode jupyter extension
- [ ] ipykernel package (should auto install upon executing running interactive window)
```
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install tqdm
pip install pyswarm
pip install pyswarms
pip install keras
pip install POT
pip install opencv-python
pip install inflect
```

## Usage
After understanding both the OptimalTransport.py library and the CustomPSO.py library you can implement these functions for almost anything given that you have an ability to process a pattern in a was both of the libraries will understand.
